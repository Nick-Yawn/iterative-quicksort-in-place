To run: `node exec.js`

To pipe output into file: `node exec.js > FILENAME` — WARNING: will override file if already exists.

You may change `ARRAY_LENGTH` in `exec.js`

Set `VERBOSE` flag in quicksort.js

A relatively competitive out-of-place "unsort" is implemented in `gen-unsorted-array.js` — you can take a look, but no need to change anything there.



This quicksort managed to sort an array with 100,000,000 values in about 13 seconds. The unsorting took 22 seconds. Not sure if there's something weird about that.
